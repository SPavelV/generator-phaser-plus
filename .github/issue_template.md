<!--

Hi! Thanks for reporting this issue. No, I won't make you fill in some awkward form or something like that. This note is here to remind you of a few things:

1.  Be sure there is nothing wrong with your development environment and the tools you are using along to build your game project.

2.  Be detailed. The more information you can gather, the easier it'll be for me to solve your issue. Things like steps to reproduce the problem and comparisons between the expected outcome and actual results are time savers.

3.  Is the issue related to a third-party library, like a Phaser plugin, for example? Be sure you have carefully read its usage documentation first. If really there is a problem integrating that library into your game project, tell me the library name (and URL) and how you are using it, so I can look for it, verify and reproduce your problem, if necessary.

4.  I may ask you anytime the following information, so have those handy:

    *   Which Node.js version you're using to build the project;

    *   Which package manager (npm or Yarn) and version you're using to manage dependencies;

    *   The project configuration created by Yeoman (the `.yo-rc.json` file).

5.  Feel free to offer suggestions, like documentation, new features and improvements in general.

6.  Please, be patient: I develop this software alone and on my spare time. It may take a while to send you a reply and solve your issue.
