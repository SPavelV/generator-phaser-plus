`generator-phaser-plus` is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) plugin that makes creating [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) Web game projects simple, quick and easy.

This repository contains both the generator code and its template projects, conveniently organized as individual directories.

*   **`generator`**: Contains the generator code and development scripts.

*   **`templates`**: Contains the sample projects. Those are fully runnable, preview versions of the projects created by the generator and updates made here are extracted back as generator templates.

For more info, take a look at the project [development guide][docs].
