## A Note Regarding Pull Requests

For the time being, I am not accepting pull requests to change the generator behavior for a few reasons:

1.  ~~**A complete revamp of the repository contents is overdue**. Perhaps the most annoying fact about this project is splitting the generator and its template projects in two distinct branches. Moving to a true "monorepo" model, keeping these in the `master` branch will lessen the entry gap for new contributors, and also open room for future planned expansions of the project.~~ (**2017-07-15**: As of this date, save for a few details still being sorted out, the templates and the generator now live under the same development branch.)

2.  **A development guide of sorts is being worked on**. For those not very familiar with Yeoman or Node.js in general, its welcoming and sensible to provide a simple guide demonstrating the required steps for developing and submitting changes to the project. Such guide will also help establish guidelines for contributions.

>   It doesn't mean I don't welcome or will blindly reject any code contributions. However, unless you really prove you know your way around the development tools and this repository peculiarities, I cannot accept pull requests before addressing the aforementioned issues first.
