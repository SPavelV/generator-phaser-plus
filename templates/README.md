`generator-phaser-plus` Templates
=================================

<div align="center"><img src="../docs/media/logo.png"></div>

Here you will find the [`generator-phaser-plus`](../generator/#readme) project templates.

The provided projects present here contain the same sample game and include only the essential features to start game development with Phaser right away. Changes made here are extracted back and become actual project templates in the generator.

Currently, the following templates are available.

As the name implies, this is the default project template created by `generator-phaser-plus`. Contains a very basic Webpack configuration. Application scripts are authored using ECMAScript syntax and modules. Includes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), configured with [`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env), to compile and bundle scripts in a format compatible with today's browsers and devices.

>   **Note**: This is the project template being developed to be shipped with `generator-phaser-plus@3.0.0`.
